**Figure 1 | Dynamic Consistency Sequence Test (DCTS) results comparing catastrophic forgetting rates.**
The graph illustrates the Disaster Forgetting Rate (DSR) as a function of the Contradiction Sequence Length ($N$). **Red dashed line**: Traditional Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a sigmoidal failure mode, where DSR rapidly approaches 1.0 (100% forgetting) as the sequence of logical contradictions increases, typically crossing the Collapse Threshold ($DSR > 0.9$) at $N \approx 20$. **Green solid line**: Cosmos-Net, employing a Moebius Topology architecture, maintains a near-zero DSR regardless of sequence length. This demonstrates the system's ability to internalize contradictions as structural growth rather than data overwrites, achieving dynamic completeness without catastrophic forgetting. Shaded regions represent the 95% confidence interval of the failure probability density.

Three-dimensional embedding of the Cosmos-Net neural topology after fusing a self-referential Godel proposition. The manifold structure evolves from a standard Euclidean plane into a non-orientable Moebius strip, visually representing the system's dimensionality increment to accommodate logical paradoxes. **Color gradient (Viridis)**: Represents the local curvature intensity, correlating with the "gravitational" weight of the contradiction. **Black points**: Individual neural nodes (MemoryStars) mapped onto the surface. **Grey lines**: Synaptic resonance paths reshaping to connect formerly distant semantic regions, physically bridging the logical gap created by the paradox. This geometric transformation proves that Cosmos-Net resolves logical incompleteness by expanding the solution space dimension rather than rejecting the input.
